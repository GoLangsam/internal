"[Daryl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_(magician)) *(August 13, 1955 - February 24, 2017)* was the professional name of *Daryl Easton*, (formerly *Daryl Martinez*), an American magician based in Las Vegas.
In his marketing he used the self-proclaimed title of "*The Magician's Magician*".
Daryl usually went by his forename only.

A ***really*** friendly, houmorous (and **devilish** clever) guy - and rightfully a worldchampion in his craft.

It's been **great honour** and **big fun** to meet with him and to e.g. translate him simultaneous into German during some of his lecture tours - some years ago.
Daryl: We miss You!
