# internal

***Hide, what You don't want the audience to see*** - [Daryl](Daryl.md)

`internal` - anything inside is not exported to any package above - only to siblings and their descendants.

Thus: A great place to 'hide' stuff in plain sight :-)

stuff that is either
- not good enough (yet) or
- not general enough (yet)
in order to be used in Your project.
